# The Codex of Divine Harmony

## Overview
The **Codex of Divine Harmony** is a Kabbalistic dashboard designed to explore the hidden structure of reality through numbers, symbols, and sacred geometry. Inspired by the interplay between **Tohu (chaos) and Tikun (order)**, this project provides a tool for interpreting the universe's patterns and harmonizing the seen with the unseen.
